                Below are links to the different parts of the report.
                There are some differences between my local version of ROOT (version 6.32) and the installed
                version on the linux lab (currently version 6.24).
                About linkdef and compiling should hopefully be in-depth enough for it to be reproducible.

                These pages are also linked to git. Should I make changes, either to the source code or the report after the fact, these can be obtained with
                <code> 
                    git pull
                </code>,
                or if you would like to see the changes without overwriting local changes, go to <a href="https://github.com/Sondren1288/planetary-sim">my github</a>.
                Should something be broken, issues can also be raised here, as well as questions when things are unclear.
