## Priority 
* Add more of the major moons
* Add increase / decrease in tail-length ?

* Add orbit randomness, so as not to start all planets on a line.
* Add orbital inclination above the ecliptic plane
* Maybe draw names above the planets when paused?



### Notes to self
Slows down significantly when it reaches 2000+ iterations. 1000 is still manageable, but drawing 2k+ seems to be unnessesary


### Done
* More accurate orbits with initial velocity using aphelion.
* Verlet method implemented
* All full planets in solar system are added.
* Draw 10 000 steps at once
