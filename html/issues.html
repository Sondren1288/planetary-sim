            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>
            In general, the project should compile just fine, and you should get a 
            <code>libRootLib.so</code> and a 
            <code>Project.out</code>.
            If these files does not exist, then the program has to be made by calling <code>make</code> in the <code>src</code> directory.
            The issues usually appear when you try to run <code>Projet.out</code>, as you get an eroor that should look something like
            </p>
            <pre><code>input_line_28:2:2: error: 'Main' is not a class, namespace, or enumeration
 Main::someFunc()
 ^
input_line_28:2:2: note: 'Main' declared here</code></pre>
            <p>
            This is an issue when I try to run it on the ROOT version that is built in on the machines in the linux lab, 
            but it does not appear as an issue when I run it on version 6.32.
            I cannot tell why this happens either, because the other way of running the program,
            <code>root libRootLib.so</code>, seems to work just fine.
            You can confirm this yourself by either 
            </p>
            <pre><code>~/src$ root libRootLib.so
// or
~/src$ root
root[0] .L libRootLib.so
// and then running the program
root[1] run()</code></pre>       
            
            <h2>Resizing window</h2>
            <p>
            If you try to resize the window, you may notice that the terminal will spam a message along the lines of
            <pre><code>Warning in TCanvas::ResizePad: gPad has at least one zero dimension.</code></pre>
            I am not quite sure why the canvas is unable to get its own dimensions when running in GNOME, which I assume is the perpetrator (it works in i3 just fine).
            This warning can be safely ignored. Performance impact, however, is unknown, so I would recommend not resizing the window, but rather change it in source and rebuild, should you want other sizes.
