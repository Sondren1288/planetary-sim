        <h1>On <code>linkdef.h</code> and compiling <code>ROOT</code> as standalone</h1>
        There is another folder, called <code>rootCompileTest</code>.
        This file contains a relatively simple <code>main</code>, that simply draws 2 buttons and prints output to the terminal when pressed.
        As a result, the <code>linkdef.h</code> is also quite simple:
        <pre><code>#if defined(__CLING__)

#pragma link C++ nestedclasses;
#pragma link C++ nestedtypedefs;

#include "main.hpp"

#pragma link C++ class Main;

#pragma link C++ function someFunc();
#pragma link C++ function run();

#endif</code></pre>
        This is the most important file to get <code>ROOT</code> to recognize functions made in other programs, after it has been compiled.
        For a compiled program to be able to launch functions outside of <code>ROOT</code> with buttons, or other commands, then this file is essential.
        The <code>nestedclasses</code> and <code>nestedtypedefs</code> are necessary for some cases, but it is in general a good idea to include them.
        <code>#include "main.hpp"</code> is very important, as it makes functions and classes defined in <code>main.hpp</code> available to the file in general.
        Without it, we could not do <code>#pragma link C++ class Main;</code>.
        If we take a look at <code>main.hpp</code>
        <pre><code>#ifndef MAIN_CLASS
#define MAIN_CLASS


#include <TApplication.h>

class Main {
    public:
        void static someFunc();
        void static run(TApplication *app);
};
void someFunc();
void run();

#endif</code></pre>
        First we define a <code>MAIN_CLASS</code>.
        This tells the compiler to only run this section once.
        It is a good idea to alway do this, but it should compile fine without it.
        Next we see the creation of some class called <code>Main</code>, but the name is not important, as long as it is consistent between <code>linkdef.h, main.hpp</code> and <code>main.cpp</code>.
        We also define some functions, one <code>someFunc()</code> and one <code>run()</code>.
        If you look back to the code from <code>linkdef.h</code>, we see we link some functions with <code>#pragma link C++ function someFunc();</code>.
        For these functions to be linkeable they <i>have</i> to be defined in <code>main.hpp</code> or somewhere else that is included in linkdef, even if what the function does is not declared before in the <code>main.cpp</code>.
        Again, <code>main.hpp, main.cpp, someFunc()</code> and <code>run()</code> are arbitrary names.
        The thing that matters is that it is consistent.
        Below is the code for <code>main.cpp</code>, without the <code>#include</code> that is a the top.
        <pre><code>#include "main.hpp"

//TCanvas *Main::canv = new TCanvas();

void Main::someFunc() {
    std::cout << "Pressed" << std::endl;
}

void someFunc() {
    std::cout << "Other pressed" << std::endl;
}

void Main::run(TApplication *app = nullptr) {
    
    TCanvas *canv = new TCanvas();
    canv->cd();
    TButton *but = new TButton("P1", "Main::someFunc()", 0.1, 0.1, 0.45, 0.9);
    TButton *but2 = new TButton("P2", "someFunc()", 0.55, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9);
    but->Draw();
    but2->Draw();
    while (1) {
        gSystem->ProcessEvents();
    }
    if (nullptr != app) {
        app->Run();
    }
}

void run() {
    Main::run();
};

int main() {
    TApplication *app = new TApplication("App", 0, 0);
    Main::run(app);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        Here we can see the <code>run()</code> function gets a meaning, as well as <code>someFunc()</code>.
        Please also notice that there is a function <code>Main::someFunc()</code> that does essentially the same, but it is not explicitly stated in <code>linkdef.h</code>.
        This is because we defined the class <code>#pragma link C++ class Main;</code>, as well as the <code>#pragma link C++ nestedclasses;</code>.
        We therefore do not need to explicitly state which functions from classes should be included when compiling with the <code>linkdef.h</code>.
        If you still wonder why we do this, it is to be able to use the <code>TButton("P1), "Main::someFunc()");</code> without getting errors, like
        <pre><code>input_line_28:2:2: error: 'Main' is not a class, namespace, or enumeration
 Main::someFunc()
 ^
input_line_28:2:2: note: 'Main' declared here</code></pre>

        <h2>Makefile</h2>
        The makefile is relatively messy, so let's do this one in parts.
        Be aware that sometimes order matters, so if it does not work, check if the order of the arguments are correct.
        <pre><code>DEPS := 
DEP_FILES := main.hpp
ROOT_GLIBS := $(shell root-config --glibs)
ROOT_CFLAGS := $(shell root-config --cflags)
ROOT_LIBS := $(shell root-config --libs)
NAME := Project
DEBUG := Debug</code></pre>
        The first line is currently empty.
        If you look at the makefile in <code>src</code> you will see that this file contains all the <code>.cpp</code> files.
        These are the files that your compiled program relies on.
        The second line, <code>DEP_FILES</code> should contain all the files your <code>linkdef.h</code> uses.
        Here, this is just <code>main.hpp</code>, but it could be more files as well.
        The next 3 lines contain important flags and include-libraries for <code>ROOT</code>.
        You can check what these are by writing them in the shell like
        <pre><code>~$ root-config --glibs</code></pre>
        The next 2 lines are the name of the output file, and then the name of the debug file.
        Having a debug file is not strictly necessary, but it is useful when trying to figure out where your program crashes.

        <br>
        <br>
        The next lines are
        <pre><code>default: dict_output.cxx libRootLib.so $(NAME).out

dict_output.cxx: $(DEP_FILES) linkdef.h
	rootcling -f $@ $^</code></pre>
        The <code>default: dict_output.cxx libRootLib.so $(NAME).out</code> will be the "default" target for compiling, not because it is called default but because it is the first line that is not a declaration.
        It will also try to compile the 3 listed targets, <code>dict_output.cxx, libRootLib.so</code> and <code>$(NAME).out</code>.
        Writing <code>$(NAME)</code> is a way to get the value we gave to the variable.
        Had the name only been one letter long, we would not need the parenthesis, but as we defined the name as <code>NAME</code>, we need to envelop it in a parenthesis.
        Then comes the first target; <code>dict_output.cxx</code>.
        The things that appear after the colon are the files <code>make</code> will check for changes in when compiling.
        If no changes were made since last time this target was compiled, then it will skip this target, as it assumes it is still up to date.
        You can force it to recompile with <code>make -B</code> in the terminal.
        <pre><code>rootcling -f $@ $^</code></pre>
        is what compiles the dictionaries that <code>ROOT</code> uses.
        <code>$@</code> is simply copying the name that is the target, or <code>dict_output.cxx</code>.
        <code>$^</code> is a copy of whatever is on the right of the colon.
        In this case, that is <code>$(DEP_FILES)</code> and <code>linkdef.h</Code>.
        When <code>make</code> runs this line, what it really writes is
        <pre><code>rootcling -f dict_output.cxx main.hpp linkdef.h</code></pre>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        The following 2 lines make the <code>libRootLib.so</code> that is used when running the program throug <code>ROOT</code>, and when compiled to an executable.
        <pre><code>libRootLib.so: dict_output.cxx $(DEPS) main.cpp
    g++ -shared -g -fPIC -o $@ $^ -I./ $(ROOT_GLIBS) $(ROOT_LIBS) $(ROOT_CFLAGS) </code></pre>
        This time it is compiled with <code>g++</code> instead of <code>rootcling</code>.
        <code>-shared</code> is a linking option, while <code>-g</code> tells the compiler to keep original names in the compiled binary.
        You will also see this flag in the debug target.
        This is so that one can stop at breakpoints and see where in the code the execution is actually happening.
        I suspect it is requires so that <code>ROOT</code> know which part of the code to run when you call a function, but this is pure speculation.
        <code>-fPIC</code> means that the code is position independent.
        For more information on what this means, see the man page for <code>g++</code>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code">wikipedia</a>.
        In short, it is useful for shared libraries.
        <code>-o</code> simply states that "now comes the outputfile", and it is, in this case called <code>libRootLib.so</code>, as we can see from the symbol <code>$@</code>.
        Notice how here we also include the <code>main.cpp</code> and the output from the previous target, <code>dict_output.cxx</code>, as well as <code>DEPS</code>.
        <code>DEPS</code> was all the <code>.cpp</code> files, and is where the executable code is actually stored.
        <code>.hpp</code>, or header files, are generally only declarations.
        The last parts are generally libraries and similar needed by <code>ROOT</code>, like include libraries and compilation flags.


        <br>
        <br>
        The next 2 lines are 
        <pre><code>$(NAME).out: main.cpp $(DEPS) libRootLib.so
    g++ main.cpp -o $(NAME).out $(DEPS) $(DEP_FILES) $(ROOT_GLIBS) $(ROOT_CFLAGS) libRootLib.so</code></pre>
        This is the part that compiles the runnable program.
        Here we also need the previous target, <code>libRootLib.so</code> to compile it, as this is the library that <code>ROOT</code> will read from when executing your custom functions.

        <br>
        <br>
        The last lines are small changes.
        The debug section is for running with debugging programs such as <code>gdb</code>.
        <code>clean</code> is a target to remove files when they are no longer needed, or for general use.
        This can be expanded if desired, to include the <code>libRootLib.so</code> and dictionaries.
        <pre><code>$(DEBUG).debug: main.cpp $(DEPS) libRootLib.so
	g++ main.cpp -g -o $(DEBUG).debug $(DEPS) $(DEP_FILES) $(ROOT_GLIBS) $(ROOT_CFLAGS) libRootLib.so


all: $(NAME).out $(DEBUG).debug 
.PHONY: all

debug: $(DEBUG).debug
.PHONY: debug

.PHONY: clean

clean: 
    rm $(NAME).out $(DEBUG).debug</code></pre>
